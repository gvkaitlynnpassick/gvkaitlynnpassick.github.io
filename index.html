	<p>I am a graduate of DMACCâ€™s AAS in Graphic Design, currently working on my Bachelors 
through Grand View University. Efficient in the adobe creative suit (photoshop, illustrator, indesign, animate cc, and dream weaver) i'm ready to learn through new challenges. I especially love using the skills I have optained, to specialize in branding. One of my favorite things to do when I go out to places (stores, restraunts, online buisnesses), is to study their idenity. <br><br>
		
  <h3>Let me help you with your business cards, posters, logo designs, and more. I want to use my creative juices to get you 
	what you need, when you need it. Interested?</p></h3>
